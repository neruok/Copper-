    @Version:   1.4

    @Change-Log:
                v1.4:       Increased Cu refine rates to close [./issues/1]

                v1.3:       Added Titanium Armor Blocks.  As I'm NOT a modeller,  you get
                            the basic armor block textures,  but the icons have been updated : p
                            Titanium armor is about 80% of the weight of Light Armor,  but twice
                            the durability.  (comments for balace welcome)

                v1.2:       Removed Procedural Ore Generation due to (demand) friends comments.

                v1.0:       Initial Release

This mod adds Copper, Titanium, and Tungsten to all SE planets and moons for both base and dlc. (but not to modded planets!)
It also adjusts just about every component to make use of it. Copper can be extracted from Stone (stone to basic ingots) at a minor rate.
Tungsten and Titanium added to the advanced components to make them a bit harder and a bit more believable.
